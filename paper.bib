Commercial packages are expensive and closed source, hence they do not allow end users to modify algorithms and add custom functionality. Existing open source projects are more focused on providing a framework for integrating existing, separately installed bioinformatics packages, rather than providing user-friendly interfaces. No open source chemoinformatics workbench has previously been published, and no sucessful attempts have been made to integrate chemo- and bioinformatics into a single framework.}, number={1}, journal={BMC Bioinformatics}, author={Spjuth, Ola and Helmus, Tobias and Willighagen, Egon L. and Kuhn, Stefan and Eklund, Martin and Wagener, Johannes and Murray-Rust, Peter and Steinbeck, Christoph and Wikberg, Jarl E.}, year={2007}, month={Feb}, pages={59+}

  title={Chemical name to structure: OPSIN, an open source solution.}, volume={51}, ISSN={1549-960X}, DOI={10.1021/ci100384d}, abstractNote={We have produced an open source, freely available, algorithm (Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature, OPSIN) that interprets the majority of organic chemical nomenclature in a fast and precise manner. This has been achieved using an approach based on a regular grammar. This grammar is used to guide tokenization, a potentially difficult problem in chemical names. From the parsed chemical name, an XML parse tree is constructed that is operated on in a stepwise manner until the structure has been reconstructed from the name. Results from OPSIN on various computer generated name/structure pair sets are presented. These show exceptionally high precision (99.8%+) and, when using general organic chemical nomenclature, high recall (98.7-99.2%). This software can serve as the basis for future open source developments of chemical name interpretation.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling}, author={Lowe, Daniel M. and Corbett, Peter T. and Murray-Rust, Peter and Glen, Robert C.}, year={2011}, month={Mar}, pages={739–753}

  title={The BridgeDb framework: standardized access to gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping services}, volume={11}, ISSN={1471-2105}, DOI={10.1186/1471-2105-11-5}, abstractNote={Many complementary solutions are available for the identifier mapping problem. This creates an opportunity for bioinformatics tool developers. Tools can be made to flexibly support multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get broader coverage. This approach requires an interface layer between tools and mapping services. Here we present BridgeDb, a software framework for gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping. This framework provides a standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be connected to different identifier mapping services. This approach makes it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping. Mapping services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or to integrate custom microarray annotations. BridgeDb provides its own ready-to-go mapping services, both in webservice and local database forms. However, the framework is intended for customization and adaptation to any identifier mapping service. BridgeDb has already been integrated into several bioinformatics applications. By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, BridgeDb improves capability and flexibility of those tools. All described software is open source and available at http://www.bridgedb.org.}, number={1}, journal={BMC Bioinformatics}, author={van Iersel, Martijn P. and Pico, Alexander R. and Kelder, Thomas and Gao, Jianjiong and Ho, Isaac and Hanspers, Kristina and Conklin, Bruce R. and Evelo, Chris T.}, year={2010}, month={Jan}, pages={5+}
