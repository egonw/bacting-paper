  title={Bioclipse: an open source workbench for chemo- and bioinformatics}, volume={8}, ISSN={1471-2105}, DOI={10.1186/1471-2105-8-59}, abstractNote={There is a need for software applications that provide users with a complete and extensible toolkit for chemo- and bioinformatics accessible from a single workbench. Commercial packages are expensive and closed source, hence they do not allow end users to modify algorithms and add custom functionality. Existing open source projects are more focused on providing a framework for integrating existing, separately installed bioinformatics packages, rather than providing user-friendly interfaces. No open source chemoinformatics workbench has previously been published, and no sucessful attempts have been made to integrate chemo- and bioinformatics into a single framework.}, number={1}, journal={BMC Bioinformatics}, author={Spjuth, Ola and Helmus, Tobias and Willighagen, Egon L. and Kuhn, Stefan and Eklund, Martin and Wagener, Johannes and Murray-Rust, Peter and Steinbeck, Christoph and Wikberg, Jarl E.}, year={2007}, month={Feb}, pages={59+}

  title={Chemical name to structure: OPSIN, an open source solution.}, volume={51}, ISSN={1549-960X}, DOI={10.1021/ci100384d}, abstractNote={We have produced an open source, freely available, algorithm (Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature, OPSIN) that interprets the majority of organic chemical nomenclature in a fast and precise manner. This has been achieved using an approach based on a regular grammar. This grammar is used to guide tokenization, a potentially difficult problem in chemical names. From the parsed chemical name, an XML parse tree is constructed that is operated on in a stepwise manner until the structure has been reconstructed from the name. Results from OPSIN on various computer generated name/structure pair sets are presented. These show exceptionally high precision (99.8%+) and, when using general organic chemical nomenclature, high recall (98.7-99.2%). This software can serve as the basis for future open source developments of chemical name interpretation.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling}, author={Lowe, Daniel M. and Corbett, Peter T. and Murray-Rust, Peter and Glen, Robert C.}, year={2011}, month={Mar}, pages={739–753}
